            "Quantum computing is a revolutionary type of computing that leverages the principles of **quantum mechanics** (the physics governing the incredibly small world of atoms and subatomic particles) to perform calculations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unlike classical computers that store information as **bits** (which can be either a 0 or a 1), quantum computers use **qubits**.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown of its core concepts and how it differs:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Concepts of Quantum Computing\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Qubits (Quantum Bits):**\n",
            "    *   **Classical Bit:** Always in a definite state (0 or 1). Like a light switch that's either on or off.\n",
            "    *   **Qubit:** Can be 0, 1, or **both simultaneously** due to a quantum phenomenon called **superposition**. Imagine a spinning coin that is both heads AND tails until it lands. This means a single qubit can represent much more information than a classical bit.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Superposition:**\n",
            "    *   The ability of a qubit to exist in multiple states at once.\n",
            "    *   If you have 'n' qubits in superposition, they can represent `2^n` states simultaneously. This is where the exponential power comes from. A classical computer with 'n' bits can only represent one of those `2^n` states at any given moment.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Entanglement:**\n",
            "    *   A unique and bizarre quantum phenomenon where two or more qubits become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, no matter how far apart they are.\n",
            "    *   Measuring the state of one entangled qubit instantly tells you something about the state of the other(s), even if they are light-years away.\n",
            "    *   This \"spooky action at a distance\" allows quantum computers to perform incredibly complex correlations and computations across multiple qubits simultaneously, vastly increasing their processing power for certain problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Interference:**\n",
            "    *   Similar to how waves can interfere with each other (constructively, amplifying each other; or destructively, canceling each other out), quantum computers use interference to amplify the probability of correct answers and diminish the probability of incorrect ones.\n",
            "    *   Quantum algorithms are designed to cause incorrect solutions to cancel each other out, leaving the correct solution more prominent when measured.\n",
            "\n",
            "### How it Works (in Simple Terms)\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Initialization:** Qubits are set to an initial state, often in superposition.\n",
            "2.  **Quantum Gates:** Operations (analogous to logic gates in classical computers) are applied to the qubits to manipulate their quantum states, creating superposition and entanglement. These gates are carefully designed to perform calculations.\n",
            "3.  **Measurement:** At the end of the computation, the qubits are \"measured.\" This collapses their superposition, and they \"choose\" a definite state (0 or 1). Because of the probabilistic nature, a quantum computation might need to be run multiple times to confirm the most likely answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Why is it Powerful?\n",
            "\n",
            "The combination of superposition and entanglement allows quantum computers to:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Explore many possibilities simultaneously:** Rather than testing possibilities one by one (like a classical computer), a quantum computer can explore all of them at once.\n",
            "*   **Solve certain problems exponentially faster:** For specific types of problems, the speed-up is not just a few times faster, but *exponentially* faster, meaning problems that would take billions of years for a classical computer could potentially be solved in minutes or hours.\n",
            "\n",
            "### What Problems Can It Solve?\n",
            "\n",
            "Quantum computers are not meant to replace classical computers for everyday tasks like browsing the web or running spreadsheets. Instead, they are powerful tools for highly complex problems that are intractable for even the most powerful supercomputers today:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Drug Discovery & Material Science:** Simulating molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy to design new drugs, catalysts, and materials.\n",
            "*   **Optimization Problems:** Finding the most efficient routes (e.g., for logistics), optimizing financial portfolios, or scheduling complex operations.\n",
            "*   **Cryptography:** Breaking currently secure encryption methods (like RSA) and developing new, quantum-resistant ones.\n",
            "*   **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:** Enhancing AI algorithms for pattern recognition, data analysis, and complex learning tasks.\n",
            "*   **Financial Modeling:** Creating more accurate and sophisticated models for risk assessment and market prediction.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Current Status & Challenges\n",
            "\n",
            "Quantum computing is still in its early stages (\"NISQ - Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum\" era). Building stable, large-scale quantum computers is incredibly challenging due to:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Decoherence:** Qubits are very fragile and easily lose their quantum properties due to environmental interference (heat, vibration, electromagnetic noise).\n",
            "*   **Error Correction:** Quantum errors are difficult to detect and correct, requiring many \"physical\" qubits to create a single \"logical\" error-free qubit.\n",
            "*   **Scalability:** Building and maintaining systems with many entangled qubits is a significant engineering hurdle.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the challenges, significant progress is being made by companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft, and many startups. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields, opening up possibilities we can only begin to imagine."

The capital of France has been Paris since its liberation in 1944.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Capital punishment in France\\nSummary: Capital punishment in France (French: peine de mort en France) is banned by Article 66-1 of the Constitution of the French Republic, voted as a constitutional amendment by the Congress of the French Parliament on 19 February 2007 and simply stating \"No one can be sentenced to the death penalty\" (French: Nul ne peut être condamné à la peine de mort). The death penalty was already declared illegal on 9 October 1981 when President François Mitterrand signed a law prohibiting the judicial system from using it and commuting the sentences of the seven people on death row to life imprisonment. The last execution took place by guillotine, being the main legal method since the French Revolution; Hamida Djandoubi, a Tunisian citizen convicted of torture and murder on French soil, was put to death in September 1977 in Marseille.\\nMajor French death penalty abolitionists across time have included philosopher Voltaire; poet Victor Hugo; politicians Léon Gambetta, Jean Jaurès and Aristide Briand; and writers Alphonse de Lamartine and Albert Camus.\\n\\nPage: Capital city\\nSummary: A capital city, or just capital, is the municipality holding primary status in a country, state, province, department, or other subnational division, usually as its seat of the government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government\\'s offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, different branches of government are in different settlements, sometimes meaning multiple official capitals. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.\\nEnglish-language media often use the name of the capital metonymically to refer to the government sitting there. Thus, \"London-Washington relations\" is widely understood to mean diplomatic relations between Great Britain and the United States.', name='wikipedia', id='36f5871a-6a6b-4530-a63b-2d65c1d43a14', tool_call_id='970ce5c8-5d6b-491c-b865-adef386c9a23'),\n",

        "This assignment challenges you to build a **multi-agent research assistant** using **CrewAI** that can leverage **external tools** to gather and synthesize information. You will define multiple AI agents with distinct roles (e.g., Researcher, Analyst, Report Writer), equip them with tools (like internet search), and orchestrate their collaboration to produce a comprehensive research report on a given topic. This will demonstrate how to enable agents to interact with the real world and combine their findings to achieve a complex goal."

        "2.  **External Tool Access**: You **must** use an internet search tool. **SerperDevTool** from `crewai_tools` is recommended due to its ease of integration. You will need a Serper API key for this.\n",
        "3.  **Environment Setup**: Install the necessary Python libraries: `pip install crewai crewai_tools google-generativeai`.\n",
        "4.  **API Keys**: Securely handle your LLM API key and your Serper API key. It's best practice to load them from environment variables.\n",
        "5.  **Jupyter Notebook**: All your code, outputs, observations, and analysis must be documented in this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "6.  **Research Topic**: You will define a specific, current, and moderately complex research topic (e.g., \"The future of personalized medicine through AI\" or \"Impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity\").\n",
        "7.  **Analysis**: Critically evaluate the research process, the agents' collaboration, and the quality of the final output."

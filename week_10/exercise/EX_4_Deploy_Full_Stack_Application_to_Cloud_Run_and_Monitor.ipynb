        "This assignment focuses on deploying a full-stack web application with separate frontend and backend services to Google Cloud Run. You will learn to containerize both components, deploy them, manage environment variables, connect to a database (Cloud SQL), and set up basic monitoring and logging to observe your application's health and performance."

        "\n",
        "1.  **GCP Project Setup:**\n",
        "    * Ensure you have an active Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with billing enabled.\n",
        "    * Enable the following APIs: Cloud Run API, Cloud SQL Admin API, Artifact Registry API, Cloud Logging API, Cloud Monitoring API.\n",
        "    * Provide `gcloud services enable` commands for each required API.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Full-Stack Application:**\n",
        "    * Create a simple full-stack application. Recommended technologies:\n",
        "        * **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js (Express), Go, or Java (Spring Boot).\n",
        "            * Exposes a few REST API endpoints (e.g., `/api/items` for CRUD operations).\n",
        "            * **Must interact with a database.**\n",
        "        * **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Vue, or Angular.\n",
        "            * Consumes the backend API to display data (e.g., a list of items) and allows basic interaction (e.g., adding a new item).\n",
        "    * The application should have a `frontend` directory and a `backend` directory, each with its own `Dockerfile`.\n",
        "    * Provide the full source code for both frontend and backend, along with their respective `Dockerfile`s and any `requirements.txt` or `package.json` files.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Cloud SQL Database:**\n",
        "    * Create a new Cloud SQL instance (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL). Choose a small instance size for cost efficiency.\n",
        "    * Create a database within this instance (e.g., `myapp_db`).\n",
        "    * Create a database user with a strong password.\n",
        "    * Provide `gcloud sql instances create` and `gcloud sql databases create` commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Database Integration in Backend:**\n",
        "    * Modify your backend application to connect to the Cloud SQL instance.\n",
        "    * **Important:** Do NOT hardcode database credentials. Use environment variables (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_NAME`). Cloud Run integrates with Cloud SQL via environment variables and connections.\n",
        "    * Implement basic CRUD operations (e.g., creating a table, inserting, retrieving data).\n",
        "    * Test your backend locally to ensure it connects to the *local* database (or a temporary Cloud SQL proxy) and performs operations correctly."

        "    * Access your frontend Cloud Run URL in a web browser.\n",

        "    * Take screenshots of your running full-stack application, demonstrating data being fetched from and/or written to the database (e.g., a list of items displayed, or a successful item addition)."

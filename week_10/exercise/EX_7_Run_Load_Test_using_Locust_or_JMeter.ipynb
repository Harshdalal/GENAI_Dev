        "## Objective\n",
        "This assignment focuses on performing a load test on a web application (or an API endpoint) using either Locust (Python-based) or Apache JMeter (Java-based). You will learn to define user behavior, simulate concurrent users, execute the load test, and analyze the performance metrics to identify potential bottlenecks and assess the application's scalability."

        "1.  **Target Application Setup:**\n",
        "    * Choose or create a simple web application or API endpoint to load test. It should be easily deployable or publicly accessible.\n",
        "    * **Recommended Options:**\n",
        "        * **Simple Flask/Node.js API:** An endpoint that performs a basic calculation or a mock database lookup.\n",
        "        * **A public REST API:** (e.g., a simple weather API, a public to-do list API â€“ *ensure you comply with their terms of service and rate limits*).\n",
        "        * **A local web server:** Run a simple HTTP server (e.g., Python's `http.server`) serving a static file.\n",
        "    * State the URL of the application/endpoint you will be testing.\n",
        "    * Briefly describe the functionality of the endpoint(s) you will be testing (e.g., \"`/calculate` endpoint takes two numbers and returns their sum\").\n",

        "        * **Option A: Locust:**\n",
        "            * Create a new Python virtual environment.\n",
        "            * Install `locust` (`pip install locust`).\n",
        "        * **Option B: JMeter:**\n",
        "            * Download and install Apache JMeter from its official website. Ensure you have Java installed and configured.\n",

        "\n",
        "3.  **Basic Connectivity Test:**\n",
        "        * Before load testing, confirm that you can access your target application/endpoint from your load testing environment (e.g., using `curl`, `requests` in Python, or a browser).\n",
        "        * Show the command/code and its successful output."

        "            * Configure parameters (e.g., HTTP method, path, request body, headers).\n",
        "            * If your endpoint requires dynamic data, use JMeter's built-in functions (e.g., `__Random`, `__counter`, `__CSVDataSet`) or pre/post processors.\n",

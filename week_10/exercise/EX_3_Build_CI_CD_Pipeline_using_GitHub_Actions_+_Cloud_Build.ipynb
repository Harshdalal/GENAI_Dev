        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "This assignment focuses on building a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using a hybrid approach: GitHub Actions for triggering and basic CI steps, and Google Cloud Build for more robust build, test, and deployment stages within Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will deploy a simple web application (e.g., a Flask or Node.js app) to Cloud Run, demonstrating automated builds and deployments on code changes."

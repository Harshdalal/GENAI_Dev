        "# Assignment: Financial Analyst Agent using AutoGen and Prompt Templates\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "This assignment challenges you to build a multi-agent system for financial analysis using Microsoft AutoGen. You will design and implement a collaborative team of AI agents (e.g., a \"Financial Analyst\", a \"Data Scientist\", a \"Critic\") that use prompt templates to perform specific tasks, such as fetching financial data, analyzing it, and generating insights or reports. The goal is to demonstrate the power of autonomous agent collaboration for complex analytical tasks."

        "\n",
        "1.  **Environment Setup:**\n",
        "    * Create a new Python virtual environment.\n",
        "        * Install necessary libraries: `pyautogen`, `pandas`, `yfinance` (for stock data), `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `python-dotenv`.\n",
        "        * Provide a `requirements.txt` file.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **LLM API Key Configuration:**\n",
        "        * Obtain an API key for a suitable LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Generative AI, Anthropic). AutoGen works well with `gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`.\n",
        "        * Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=\"sk-YOUR_KEY\"`).\n",
        "        * Create an `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` structure (a list of dictionaries) in a Python file (e.g., `config.py` or directly in the notebook) as described in AutoGen documentation, referencing your environment variable.\n",
        "        * Load environment variables using `load_dotenv()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Basic AutoGen Test:**\n",
        "        * Run a simple AutoGen conversation between two agents (e.g., a `UserProxyAgent` and an `AssistantAgent`) to confirm your LLM setup is correct.\n",
        "        * Show the code and the successful conversation output."

        "\n",
        "1.  **Define Agent Roles and Capabilities:**\n",
        "        * Design at least **three** distinct agents for your financial analysis task:\n",
        "            * **`FinancialAnalystAgent` (AssistantAgent):** Responsible for interpreting financial requests, synthesizing information, and generating a final report.\n",
        "            * **`DataScientistAgent` (AssistantAgent with code execution capabilities):** Responsible for fetching data, performing calculations (e.g., historical price analysis, moving averages), and generating charts. This agent should be capable of executing Python code.\n",
        "            * **`CriticAgent` (AssistantAgent):** Responsible for reviewing the analysis and report generated by the Financial Analyst. It should identify any missing information, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement.\n",
        "        * For each agent, describe their `name`, `system_message`, and specific capabilities (e.g., `is_user_proxy=True` for UserProxyAgent, `code_execution_config` for Data Scientist).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Create Prompt Templates:**\n",
        "        * For each agent, develop custom prompt templates that guide their behavior for specific sub-tasks.\n",
        "        * **`FinancialAnalystAgent` Prompt Template:** A template for generating the final financial report, incorporating data and insights provided by other agents. It should guide the structure of the report.\n",
        "        * **`DataScientistAgent` Prompt Template:** A template that instructs the agent on how to fetch data (e.g., \"Fetch historical stock data for {ticker} from {start_date} to {end_date}\"), or how to perform a specific calculation/plot.\n",
        "        * **`CriticAgent` Prompt Template:** A template that guides the critic's review (e.g., \"Review the following financial report for completeness, accuracy, and clarity. Provide actionable feedback. Report: {report_content}\").\n",
        "        * Implement these as Python f-strings or LangChain `PromptTemplate` objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Initial Agent Setup:**\n",
        "        * Instantiate your agents with their defined roles and initial `system_message`.\n",
        "        * Configure the `UserProxyAgent` to enable code execution (e.g., `human_input_mode=\"NEVER\"` for automated testing, or `\"ALWAYS\"` for interactive debugging; `code_execution_config` for Python code execution).\n",
        "        * Show the code for agent instantiation."

        "        * Orchestrate a conversation flow using `GroupChat` and `GroupChatManager`.\n",

        "            1.  `UserProxyAgent` starts the conversation with a financial analysis request (e.g., \"Analyze the historical stock performance of TSLA for the last year and provide key insights and a sentiment.\").\n",
        "            2.  `FinancialAnalystAgent` receives the request, understands it, and delegates data fetching/analysis to the `DataScientistAgent` using the appropriate prompt template.\n",
        "            3.  `DataScientistAgent` fetches data (using `yfinance`), performs analysis, generates a plot, and returns findings (e.g., dataframe, plot path, summary) to the group.\n",
        "            4.  `FinancialAnalystAgent` synthesizes the data scientist's findings into a draft financial report, potentially using its report prompt template.\n",
        "            5.  `CriticAgent` reviews the draft report using its prompt template and provides feedback.\n",
        "            6.  `FinancialAnalystAgent` incorporates feedback and generates a revised final report.\n",
        "            7.  The conversation ends with the final report.\n",

        "        * Initiate the conversation using `user_proxy.initiate_chat()`.\n",
        "        * Choose a specific financial analysis request (e.g., \"Analyze the stock performance of Google (GOOGL) over the past 6 months, calculate its daily returns, and summarize key trends. Also, provide a short sentiment analysis on recent news if possible.\")\n",
        "        * Capture and display the full conversation history.\n",

        "        * Identify any instances of suboptimal interaction, loops, or misunderstandings.\n",
        "        * How did the prompt templates guide the agents' responses and actions?"

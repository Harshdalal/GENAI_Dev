        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "This assignment focuses on two crucial aspects of professional software development: peer code review and architecture walkthroughs. You will act as both a developer presenting your work and a reviewer providing constructive feedback. The goal is to improve code quality, share knowledge, identify potential issues early, and ensure architectural coherence and understanding within a team setting."

        "\n",
        "1.  **Select/Develop a Project:**\n",
        "        * Choose an existing project you've worked on (from a previous assignment, personal project, or a small open-source contribution) or create a new small-to-medium-sized application for this assignment.\n",
        "        * **Project Requirements:**\n",
        "            * It should be a functional application (e.g., a simple web service, a data processing script, a machine learning pipeline, a mobile app component).\n",
        "            * It must have at least 100-200 lines of *your own* code (excluding boilerplate/libraries).\n",
        "            * It should have a clear purpose and a defined architecture (even if simple).\n",
        "            * It must be version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.\n",
        "        * Provide a link to your project's Git repository.\n",
        "        * Briefly describe your project: its purpose, key features, and the technologies used.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Architecture Diagram (Initial Draft):**\n",
        "        * Create an initial high-level architecture diagram for your project.\n",
        "        * This diagram should illustrate:\n",
        "            * The main components of your system.\n",
        "            * How they interact with each other.\n",
        "            * Any external dependencies (databases, APIs, cloud services).\n",
        "            * Data flow (optional, but good to show).\n",
        "        * Use any diagramming tool (e.g., Draw.io, Lucidchart, Excalidraw, PlantUML, even a hand-drawn clear image).\n",
        "        * Embed the diagram image here.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Prepare for Code Review:**\n",
        "        * Identify a specific feature or logical unit within your project that you want to be reviewed. This could be a new module, a core algorithm, or a specific API endpoint.\n",
        "        * Ensure your code for this feature is clean, has meaningful variable names, and is ideally accompanied by some inline comments for complex logic (though over-commenting is discouraged).\n",
        "        * Create a new Git branch for this feature (e.g., `feature/review-this-module`).\n",
        "        * Make at least 3-5 meaningful commits on this branch related to the feature.\n",
        "        * Open a Pull Request (PR) or Merge Request (MR) targeting your `main` or `develop` branch. *Do not merge it yet.* Provide a link to this PR.\n",
        "        * Write a clear PR description outlining:\n",
        "            * What the feature does.\n",
        "            * Why it was implemented this way.\n",
        "            * Any specific areas you'd like the reviewer to focus on.\n",
        "            * Instructions for testing/running the code (if applicable)."

        "# Assignment: Trigger Pipeline using Cloud Pub/Sub Message\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "This assignment focuses on building an event-driven pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where a process is triggered by a Cloud Pub/Sub message. You will set up a Pub/Sub topic, create a Cloud Function (or Cloud Run service) to act as a subscriber, and then trigger a subsequent Cloud Build pipeline (or another process) based on the content of the Pub/Sub message. This demonstrates asynchronous communication and automation of workflows."

        "1.  **GCP Project Setup:**\n",
        "    * Ensure you have an active Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with billing enabled.\n",
        "    * Enable the following APIs: Cloud Pub/Sub API, Cloud Functions API (or Cloud Run API), Cloud Build API, Cloud Logging API.\n",
        "    * Provide `gcloud services enable` commands for each required API.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Cloud Pub/Sub Topic and Subscription:**\n",
        "    * Create a new Cloud Pub/Sub topic (e.g., `my-trigger-topic`).\n",
        "    * Create a subscription to this topic (e.g., `my-trigger-subscription`). You can choose a pull or push subscription, but for this assignment, a push subscription often makes sense for Cloud Functions/Run.\n",
        "    * Provide `gcloud pubsub topics create` and `gcloud pubsub subscriptions create` commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Dummy Cloud Build Configuration (or Target Process):**\n",
        "        * To simulate a pipeline, create a very simple `cloudbuild.yaml` file that just prints a message or runs a trivial command.\n",
        "        * This `cloudbuild.yaml` should be stored in a GitHub/Cloud Source Repository, or you can use a basic inline build step for simplicity for the purpose of this assignment.\n",
        "        * The idea is that your Pub/Sub triggered component will eventually trigger *this* build.\n",
        "        * Provide the content of your `cloudbuild.yaml` (e.g., `steps: - name: 'ubuntu' args: ['echo', 'Pipeline triggered by Pub/Sub message!']`)."

LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications with LLMs. It allows integration of language models with tools, APIs, and external data. 

Agentic RAG systems combine retrieval-based context fetching with agent-based reasoning. These systems can access knowledge sources and decide what to do based on the user's query.

Google's Gemini model provides strong reasoning capabilities and can be used as the LLM in LangChain pipelines.

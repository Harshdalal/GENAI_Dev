        "This assignment focuses on building an interactive web-based frontend for a Question-Answering (QA) bot using Streamlit. You will connect a backend QA system (either a simple local one or the previously built RAG API) to a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input questions and receive answers."

        "1.  **Environment Setup:**\n",
        "    * Create a new Python virtual environment.\n",
        "    * Install necessary libraries: `streamlit`, `requests` (if connecting to an API), and any libraries required by your QA backend (e.g., `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `torch`/`transformers` if running QA locally).\n",
        "    * Provide a `requirements.txt` file.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **QA Backend Setup:**\n",
        "    * **Option A (Recommended):** Integrate with your previously built FastAPI RAG API.\n",
        "        * Ensure your FastAPI application is running locally (e.g., `uvicorn main:app --reload`).\n",
        "        * Your Streamlit app will make `requests` to this API.\n",
        "    * **Option B:** Implement a simplified local QA bot for this assignment.\n",
        "        * This bot should be able to answer questions based on a small, fixed set of documents (e.g., 5-10 paragraphs).\n",
        "        * Use `sentence-transformers` for embeddings and a simple `cosine_similarity` search to find the most relevant paragraph.\n",
        "        * A simple rule-based or a very small pre-trained model (like `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst2`) can be used for 'answering' by simply returning the most similar chunk or a placeholder.\n",
        "    * Clearly describe which QA backend option you are using and its setup."

        "\n",
        "3.  **Displaying Responses:**\n",
        "    * Create an area to display the bot's answer (`st.write` or `st.markdown`).\n",
        "    * Clearly label the answer (e.g., \"Answer:\").\n",
        "    * Implement a mechanism to display the retrieved documents or context that the answer is based on (e.g., `st.expander` or `st.info`). This is crucial for demonstrating the RAG aspect.\n",
        "        * Label this section (e.g., \"Retrieved Context:\").\n",
        "\n",

        "5.  **Session State (for conversation history - Optional, for extra credit):**\n",
        "    * Implement Streamlit's `st.session_state` to maintain a simple conversation history (e.g., display previous questions and answers)."

        "This assignment focuses on containerizing a web application (e.g., your FastAPI RAG API or Streamlit app from previous assignments) using Docker and deploying it to Google Cloud Run. You will gain hands-on experience with Dockerizing applications, managing dependencies, and deploying serverless containers."

            " In AI, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines large language models (LLMs) with a document retrieval system.  It uses the retrieval system, often employing tools like FAISS for efficient similarity search, to find relevant documents related to a user's query.  These documents are then used to augment the LLM's input, allowing the LLM to generate more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant responses.\n",

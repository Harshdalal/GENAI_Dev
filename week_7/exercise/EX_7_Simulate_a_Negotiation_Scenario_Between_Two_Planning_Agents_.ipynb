        "### Objective:\n",
        "This assignment challenges you to design and implement a **negotiation scenario between two AI planning agents** using a multi-agent framework. Each agent will have its own goals, preferences, and a strategy for negotiation. The goal is to observe how these agents interact, propose solutions, and potentially reach a mutually agreeable outcome or a stalemate. This will demonstrate the complexities of multi-agent communication and strategic decision-making in a constrained environment."

        "1.  **LLM Access**: You'll need access to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo). Configure your API key securely.\n",
        "2.  **Multi-Agent Framework**: **AutoGen** is highly recommended for simulating the agent interactions. Its flexibility in defining roles and conversational patterns makes it ideal for this task.\n",
        "3.  **Scenario: Project Task Allocation Negotiation**: Imagine two project managers (Agent A and Agent B) who need to allocate a set of tasks for an upcoming project. They have different preferences for tasks and deadlines.\n",
        "    * **Agent A's Goal**: Prioritize Task X and complete it by Monday.\n",
        "    * **Agent B's Goal**: Prioritize Task Y and ensure no task extends beyond Wednesday.\n",
        "    * **Tasks**: A list of tasks with estimated efforts and ideal deadlines (e.g., `{'Task A': {'effort': 3, 'deadline': 'Tuesday'}, ...}`).\n",
        "    * **Constraints**: Total effort per agent per day, or combined effort constraints.\n",
        "4.  **Agent Design**: Create at least two `AssistantAgent`s. Each agent should have:\n",
        "    * A distinct **role** and **system message** defining its personality and negotiation objectives.\n",
        "    * The ability to propose a task allocation plan.\n",
        "    * The ability to evaluate a proposal from the other agent against its own goals.\n",
        "    * The ability to counter-propose or accept/reject proposals.\n",
        "    * A mechanism to indicate successful negotiation or a stalemate (e.g., a specific termination message).\n",
        "5.  **User Proxy**: A `UserProxyAgent` will act as an impartial observer or a facilitator, initiating the negotiation and signaling termination.\n",
        "6.  **Jupyter Notebook**: All your code, outputs, observations, and analysis must be documented in this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "7.  **Analysis**: Explain your agent design, negotiation strategy, and the observed outcomes. Discuss the challenges and insights gained from simulating this scenario."
